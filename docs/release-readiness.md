# Release Readiness Checklist - nebari-langfuse (Beta)

This document records the status of every `[E]` (Experimental), `[A]` (Alpha), and `[B]`
(Beta) item from the Nebari software pack maturity checklist
(`/tmp/nebari-software-pack-template/docs/release-readiness-checklist.md`) as applied to
the `nebari-langfuse` pack.

`[GA]` items are **out of scope** for this promotion and are not listed.

Items marked "covered by Task N" are satisfied by a later task in the implementation plan
and have not yet been verified at the time this document was authored (2026-06-10). They
will be confirmed at the Task 13 journey-verification gate before a formal promotion PR
is opened.

Items marked "EXTERNAL / human" cannot be completed inside this repo. They are listed
with justification and must be resolved as follow-up actions before or at promotion time.

## Ownership and Identity

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Repo is created from the software pack template | `[E]` | N/A - effectively satisfied | The pack was not forked from a template repo (none existed at authoring time) but mirrors the template structure exactly: `chart/`, `examples/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `dev/`, `.github/workflows/`, `CODEOWNERS`, `pack-metadata.yaml`, `LICENSE`. All template-required files are present. |
| `CODEOWNERS` names at least one accountable engineer | `[E]` | done | `CODEOWNERS` at repo root: `* @dcmcand` (this commit). |
| `pack-metadata.yaml` exists, validates against schema, declares level + owner + scope flags | `[E]` | done (schema validation: see note) | `pack-metadata.yaml` at repo root (this commit). `level: beta`, `owner: dcmcand`, `scope.standalone-supported: yes`. Schema URL returned 404 at authoring time (dashboard schema not yet published); CI `check-jsonschema` step (Task 11) is the authoritative validation gate. |
| Pack is listed in `nebari-dev/software-pack-dashboard/tracked-packs.yaml` | `[E]` | EXTERNAL - separate repo | Must be added in a follow-up PR to `nebari-dev/software-pack-dashboard`. Cannot be done in this repo. |
| README explains what the pack does and who it is for | `[E]` | covered by Task 9 | `README.md` authored in Task 9. |
| `product_owner` field is populated in `pack-metadata.yaml` | `[B]` | done | `product_owner: dcmcand` in `pack-metadata.yaml` (this commit). |

## Installation

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Installs cleanly on a fresh current-release NIC dev cluster following only the README instructions | `[A]` | covered by Task 13 | Journey 1 verification gate (live kind cluster). |
| Prerequisites documented (NIC version, cluster sizing, namespace labels, external dependencies) | `[A]` | covered by Task 9 | `README.md` Prerequisites section. |
| `helm lint` passes in CI | `[B]` | covered by Task 11 | `.github/workflows/lint.yaml` and `.github/workflows/test.yaml`. |
| `helm template` renders correctly with NebariApp enabled and disabled | `[B]` | covered by Task 11 | CI renders both paths; also exercised in Task 12 pre-cluster gate. |
| Schema validation passes (kubeconform or equivalent) in CI | `[B]` | covered by Task 11 | `test.yaml` workflow includes kubeconform against NebariApp CRD schema. |

---

## NebariApp Integration

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| `NebariApp` reaches Ready condition with all applicable sub-conditions healthy (RoutingReady, TLSReady, AuthReady) | `[A]` | covered by Task 13 | Journey 2 verification gate. |
| All configurable NebariApp fields used by the pack are documented in the values reference | `[A]` | covered by Task 9 | `docs/configuration.md` values reference section. |
| `nebariapp_integration` field in `pack-metadata.yaml` accurately reflects integration depth | `[A]` | done | `nebariapp_integration: full` - the pack provisions a Keycloak client and runs full app-native OAuth through the NebariApp CRD. |
| Auth-protected routes reject unauthenticated requests (auth enabled) | `[B]` | covered by Task 16 | Journey 11 - E2E black-box test (`tests/e2e/run.sh` assertion 3: `POST /api/public/otel/v1/traces` with no credentials returns 401). |
| Auth-protected routes allow authenticated users with correct group membership (auth enabled) | `[B]` | covered by Task 13 | Journey 3 verification gate (browser SSO walkthrough). |
| Health/readiness probes configured and verified | `[B]` | upstream chart + covered by Task 16 | Upstream `langfuse/langfuse` chart sets liveness probe `GET /api/public/health` and readiness probe `GET /api/public/ready` on the web container. E2E `run.sh` asserts health endpoint returns 200. |

## Documentation

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| README exists with: what the pack does, who it is for, deploy command | `[E]` | covered by Task 9 | `README.md`. |
| README includes prerequisites and a "Known Limitations" section | `[A]` | covered by Task 9 | `README.md` Prerequisites and Known Limitations sections. |
| Authentication setup is documented | `[B]` | covered by Task 9 | `docs/configuration.md` SSO wiring section; `README.md` auth model summary. |
| Troubleshooting section covers common failure modes | `[B]` | covered by Task 9 | `README.md` Troubleshooting section (NebariApp not Ready, image pull errors, login redirect mismatch, ENCRYPTION_KEY crash, ClickHouse resources). |
| Upstream chart values that users need to customize are documented | `[B]` | covered by Task 9 | `docs/configuration.md` values reference covers `langfuse.langfuse.*`, `langfuse.postgresql.*`, `langfuse.clickhouse.*`, `langfuse.redis.*`, `langfuse.s3.*`. |

---

## Examples

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| At least one example values file that deploys without modification (other than hostname) | `[A]` | done | `examples/nebari-values.yaml` (Task 7). |
| Example values file for full Nebari deployment (`nebari-values.yaml`) | `[B]` | done | `examples/nebari-values.yaml` (Task 7). |
| Example values file for standalone deployment (`standalone-values.yaml`) - `standalone-supported: yes` | `[B]` | done | `examples/standalone-values.yaml` (Task 7). |
| ArgoCD Application example that references the published Helm repo | `[B]` | done | `examples/argocd-app.yaml` (Task 7). |

---

## Telemetry

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| `ServiceMonitor` or `PodMonitor` exposed, or documented justification for not exposing metrics | `[B]` | covered by Task 15 | Task 15 adds an opt-in `podmonitor.yaml` template (default off, `metrics.podMonitor.enabled: false`). Justification for default-off: the upstream chart ships no native `/metrics` endpoint; enabling PodMonitor without a proper metrics endpoint produces scrape errors. Users running kube-state-metrics or the upstream Prometheus adapter can enable it. The justification is documented in `docs/configuration.md` telemetry section and `README.md`. |
| Application logs are written to stdout/stderr in a structured format (JSON preferred) | `[B]` | satisfied by upstream | Langfuse web and worker containers emit JSON-structured logs to stdout/stderr by default (no log-shipping sidecar needed). Documented in `README.md` telemetry section (Task 9). |

---

## Security

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Containers do not run as root (or have documented justification if they must) | `[B]` | covered by Task 15 | Task 15 sets `runAsNonRoot: true` in the securityContext for the `langfuse-web` and `langfuse-worker` containers via the upstream chart's `podSecurityContext` passthrough. Bitnami sub-chart images already run non-root. Verified at Task 13. |
| No secrets hardcoded in templates or default values | `[B]` | done | All secrets are generated at runtime via `lookup`+`randAlphaNum` (no static values). The OIDC issuer placeholder is `REPLACE-ME` (not a real credential). Task 12 grep assertion confirms no inline secret values in rendered output. |
| OIDC scopes minimally scoped to what the app needs | `[B]` | done | Default scopes in `values.yaml`: `[openid, profile, email]` - the minimum required for Langfuse user identity (Task 4). |
| Upstream container images pinned to a specific tag or digest (never `latest`) | `[B]` | done | Langfuse `3.179.1`; all Bitnami sub-chart images are `bitnamilegacy/*` with pinned tags (frozen by upstream chart `langfuse 1.5.34`). Task 12 `no :latest` assertion. |

---

## Release Engineering

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Chart is publishable to `nebari-dev.github.io/helm-repository` | `[B]` | covered by Task 11 | `.github/workflows/release.yaml` configures chart-releaser for `nebari-dev.github.io/helm-repository`. |
| Release workflow is configured and at least one pre-1.0 release has been published | `[B]` | workflow: covered by Task 11; actual publish: EXTERNAL - requires a tag push | The `release.yaml` workflow is configured in Task 11. An actual published release requires pushing a version tag (`v0.1.0`) to trigger it - this happens at release time, outside the code tasks. Tracked as a follow-up. |
| `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml` matches the upstream application version being wrapped | `[B]` | done | `chart/Chart.yaml` `appVersion: "3.179.1"` matches `langfuse/langfuse` chart `1.5.34` which deploys Langfuse `3.179.1` (Task 1). |

---

## Pre-sales Verification

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Pre-sales engineer has run the demo end-to-end and signed off on the happy path | `[A]` | EXTERNAL - human sign-off | Required before Alpha promotion. Cannot be completed in this repo. Pre-sales engineer must run through journeys 1, 2, 3, 4 on the dev kind cluster. |
| Pre-sales engineer has confirmed the pack can be demoed without engineering on the call | `[B]` | EXTERNAL - human sign-off | Required for Beta promotion. Pre-sales rep must confirm. |
| `demo_notes` in `pack-metadata.yaml` reflects current known demo gotchas | `[B]` | done | `demo_notes` set in `pack-metadata.yaml` (this commit): SSO config requirement and bundled-datastore caveat. |

---

## Sign-off

| Item | Level | Status | Where / Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Pack owner approves the promotion PR | `[A]` | EXTERNAL - human | @dcmcand must approve the Alpha promotion PR. |
| Pre-sales rep approves the promotion PR | `[A]` | EXTERNAL - human | Pre-sales rep must approve the Alpha promotion PR. |
| Tech lead approves the promotion PR | `[B]` | EXTERNAL - human | Tech lead must approve the Alpha -> Beta promotion PR. |

## Summary of External / Human Items (cannot be completed in this repo)

These must be resolved before the Alpha -> Beta promotion PR is merged:

1. **Listed in `software-pack-dashboard/tracked-packs.yaml`** - open a PR in
   `nebari-dev/software-pack-dashboard` to add `nebari-langfuse`.
2. **At least one pre-1.0 release actually published** - push a version tag (`v0.1.0`) to
   trigger the `release.yaml` workflow after CI is green.
3. **Pre-sales "demoable without engineering" sign-off** - pre-sales engineer must run the
   demo end-to-end and sign off in the promotion PR.
4. **Pre-sales rep + tech lead promotion-PR approvals** - required reviewers per the maturity
   model promotion process table.
